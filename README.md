This program is a solution to the DC Tower Elevator coding challenge. It has been built and tested using Java 17 as the
latest Java LTS.

It uses `var` type inference, lambda-like `switch` syntax, Java records and the Java 8 Stream API.

The specifics of the simulation, namely the amount of requests it will handle, the speed at which these requests will
arrive, and the time an elevator needs to move from one floor to the next, can be changed by editing the static constant
fields at the top of the DcTowerSimulation class.
